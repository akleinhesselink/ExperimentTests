We selected plots in summer 2011.  All plots had to have grasses and at least some sagebrush. We avoided pershia and amelenchier.

We did removals in the fall of 2011--we cut sagebrush to the ground and herbicided the stumps and herbicided the grasses. I did a lot of touch-up on the grasses in April 2012.  Since then I have done follow-up treatment of grasses in the spring in April and May. There have been fewer and fewer grasses to herbicide each year.

In the "shrub" removal plots we only removed sagebrush. So those should really be considered sagebrush removal plots.
